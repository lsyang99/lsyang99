### Hello! I'm Lin!

I'm enthusiastic about exploring the link between environmental exposure and health inequity. As an air quality scientist, I focus on environmental data management, air permitting, and compliance. I specialize in analyzing and managing air quality data, particularly in assessing air monitoring data and air modeling estimations using spatial analysis and statistical methods to understand air pollution's impact on health.
